# Bikeability Optimisation
Master thesis project.

### Short Explanation

This pyhton package is designed to improve the bikeability of cities, therefore it uses bike sharing data to build a demand drive bike path network.

### Data Structure

The bike sharing trip data should be structured as follows: table (e.g. csv) with at least the following five columns:
1. latitude of start point
2. longitude of start point
3. latitude of end point
4. longitude of end point
5. number of cyclists which took this trip

todo: Explain output data structure

### Expamples

In the example folder is an example for Hamburg (hh) and Oslo. For Hamburg I use data provided by Call a Bike by Deutsche Bahn AG (License: CC BY 4.0) and for Oslo from Oslo Bysykkel (License: NLOD 2.0).
